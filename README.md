## Description

Have you ever “liked” something on Facebook? or tweeted something on Twitter? or rated a movie on IMDB? By doing that, you are creating data. Now imagine people all over the world doing the same thing for years – that’s a whole lot of data! And those data are used to answer questions like “Are dog-owners or cat-owners happier?” or “Is Jar Jar Binks the most hated character in Star Wars?” (Spoiler alert: yes.) In this workshop, you’ll learn some cool, cutting-edge skills to use computers and data to answer questions like these. You will also learn how to create impressive visualizations and produce reports that can be shared on the web.

## Objectives

The goal of this workshop is to introduce the principles of programming and data science through hands-on activities. Students will use the programming language, R, to explore real datasets.

The specific aims of the workshop are to train students in the following tasks:
* Issue commands to the computer by writing code and running it within the RStudio editor.
* Learn to produce basic reports with code and output using the R markdown format.
* Load and view simple datasets.
* Construct basic plots and graphs of the data.

## Schedule of Activities

* Introductions by workshop presenters and students - name and icebreaker fact.
* Logistics of the workshop - using post-it notes to ask for help from assistant presenters.
* Overview of workshop objectives.
* Description of the RStudio software and scripting interface.
    + Students follow along and open RStudio.
* Presenters demo the creation of R markdown files.
    + Students open the R markdown template file.
    + Students fill out the header with their name and a title.
* Explanation of R code chunks.
    + Students execute sample code chunks and view output.
* Load sample dataset into R
    + Students execute the provided code chunk to load in the data from a file.
* View sample dataset to see format
    + Students type in and run code to produce a summary of the data set.
* Make some basic plots using `ggplot2`
    + As part of this have them install and load ‘ggplot2’ (concept of libraries)
    + Students type and run code to produce a basic scatter plot.
    + Students type and run code to produce a basic bar plot.
    + If time, students type and run code to produce a basic box plot.
* Free time (give some ideas of other visualizations to be done)
    + students try making their own novel plots
        - plotting different variables
        - splitting data points or coloring data points by other variables
        - producing different types of plots (give sample visual gallery?)
* Knit final document into an HTML report
    + students do the same
* Provide link to online repository (where HTML reports will be deposited)
    + check if students are ok with submitting their reports (part of feedback - see next bullet point)
* Receive anonymous feedback from students
